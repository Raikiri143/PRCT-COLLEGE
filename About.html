  <h2>Right in the heart of Baguio is PRCT University.</h2>

      The cool climate of Baguio City has never failed to entice students for the unique university life it promises. At the fore of this is one of Baguio's premier institutions of higher learning - PRCT College
Since its foundation on August 8, 1948, the PRCT College has steadily made a name for itself as one of the summer capital's biggest universities with an average student population of 15,000.
PRCT College was granted an Autonomous Status by the Commission on Higher Education on March 11, 2009, the first non-sectarian university in CAR to be granted such. This makes UB among the select 42 private higher educational institutions granted an autonomous status out of 2,000 throughout the country.
Constantly abreast with the latest trends in its various fields of specialization, UB prepares its students for the ever-competitive world of work that awaits them after college. Its competent faculty, cutting-edge facilities, harmonious family culture, healthy campus politics, and wholesome intra-school competitions perfectly complement the cool climate of the country's summer capital, making learning fun and worthwhile.
PRCT College welcomes students from all walks of life, races, and beliefs. Through its more than six decades of existence, UB has nurtured generations of students from Baguio City, the greater Cordillera region, the rest of the country, and at least 19 foreign nations.
